You must submit the following. 

**SPSS**
  - Syntax file
  - Report in Word doc form with tables/figures cut and pasted from SPS output file

**R**
  - RMarkdown file
  - Knit report in HTML or PDF

## Part 1 - Explore the data 

1. Identify the variable types for each variable in the dataset
2. Calculate the BMI for each participant
3. Calculate a young and old variable as per data dictionary
4. Calculate the mean and standard deviation
    * For the variables were it is appropriate
    * Including the new variables you have created
5. Calculate the frequencies 
    For the variables were it is appropriate to do so
6. Draw the histogram
    * Discuss the normality of the data 
7. Are there missing data? 
8. Are there outliers? 

## Part 2 - Format and Effort 

### General Formatting
- A combination sentences/paragraphs with some bullet points is appropriate.
- Include a list of references where appropriate. For this assignment, you do not need to worry

## Data

### Purpose
These are simulated data that I created.

**Variables**		

Name	| Description |	Units 
----- | ----------- | -----  
id | 	Unique identifer for each individual participant | 	NA 
age_years | 	Age in years | 	years 
bench_press_max_lbs | 	1 rep max bench press in pounds | 	pounds 
height_cm | 	Height in centimeters | 	centimeters 
weight_kg | 	Weight in kilograms | 	kilograms 
age_category | 	Age category where less than 40 years old = young and <= 40 years old = old |	NA 

### Methods
#### Design
This study used a cross-sectional survey research design to examine the differences in the associations between age, height, weight, and bench press max.

#### Sample
The population for this study consisted of individuals residing in the St. Johnâ€™s area. A sample (n = 10,000) participants were recruited to come into the lab. 

#### Dependent Variable

Bench press max 

* Bench press max was measured using a 1RM bench press test for each participant. Participants were instructed to warm up properly and completed the PAR-Q prior to begining exercising. 

##### Independent Variables

Age

* Participants were asked their age in years, months, and days. 

Height

* Height was measured using a stadiometer

Weight

* Weight was measured using a calibrated scale
