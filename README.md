## Course Description
A critical examination of methodological research issues and quantitative research designs in the field of human kinetics and recreation. Examines and applies a variety of statistical analysis techniques which can be used in a variety of research designs. Emphasis is placed on the interpretation and implications of empirical quantitative research in the field. Students will learn statistics using either R or SPSS. 

## Course Objectives
- To introduce students to the nature of scientific inquiry and techniques of research design;
- To examine the prevalent methods and techniques of quantitative research design;
- To provide you with the understanding and knowledge necessary for refining your skills as competent researchers;
- To introduce the basics of analysis and interpretation of statistical measures, techniques, and tests, in order to provide the student with an understanding of their application human kinetics and recreation;
- To present an overview of the most commonly used descriptive statistics and inferential parametric and statistical measures and tests within human kinetics and recreation;
- To assess under what circumstances certain analytical techniques are selected and why, and to recognise the strengths and weaknesses of these decisions; and
- To afford the opportunity for computer-based applications of different procedures and techniques described in class thereby providing “hands on” experience for a practical understanding of the organisation and construction of data and measures, the selection of appropriate techniques, and the analysis and interpretation of “real” results.

## Format and Procedures

The general format of each class will include lectures and audio-visual presentations, discussions, and in-class learning activities.

This course will use this website and D2L as the method for course communication and to provide students with course materials (e.g., syllabus, handouts, instructions for assignments, readings, and course schedule). The course materials that are needed for each class will be posted on D2L a minimum of one (1) week prior to the class date. Prior to each class, students are expected to bring course materials to class, preferably on their own laptop.

**Additional readings are required. These readings will be in electronic format and will be posted on D2L. Readings will be available at least one (1) weeks prior to the reading assignment due date.**

## Academic Integrity

Students and faculty at Memorial University share an important responsibility to maintain the integrity of the teaching and learning relationship. This relationship is characterized by honesty, fairness and mutual respect for the aim and principles of the pursuit of education.

Academic misconduct impedes the activities of the university community and is punishable by appropriate disciplinary action. Students are expected to be familiar with Memorial University’s regulations on Academic Misconduct (Section 6.12 of the Academic Calendar) which sets out the kinds of actions that constitute academic misconduct, including plagiarism, copying or allowing one’s own work to copied, use of unauthorized aids in examinations and tests, submitting work prepared in collaboration with another student when such collaboration has not been authorized, and other academic offenses. The regulations also describe the procedures for dealing with allegations and the unit level as well as the university level, and the sanctions for any finding of academic misconduct, which can range from a written reprimand to a rescindment of the degree. A lack of familiarity with Memorial’s regulations on academic misconduct does not constitute a defense against its application.

If an instructor alleges that academic misconduct has occurred for evaluative instruments worth between 15-39% the course instructor is required to submit the student’s work along with a summary of the allegation to the SHKR Committee for Academic Integrity for consideration and a decision. Any allegations of misconduct that occur with evaluative instruments worth 40% or more of the final grade or final examinations are automatically sent to the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies for consideration.

Further information on academic integrity is outlined in the University Calendar 6.12: [http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0748](http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0748) Information regarding acceptable writing practices is available through the Writing Centre at [http://www.mun.ca/writingcentre/](http://www.mun.ca/writingcentre/)


## Accommodations for students with disabilities

In compliance with the Memorial University’s policy and equal access laws, it is understood that appropriate academic accommodations may be required for student with disabilities. Please see the guide for full details [http://www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239](http://www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239).

__Note 1.__ I purposefuly do not have penalties for late assignments in my courses. You will have the most success with this course if you submit the assignments the weeks suggested. There will be a steep learning curve. It will hurt. The faster you get over the learning curve, the easier, and more fun, your life will be in this course.  

__Note 2.__ There are no specific formatting rules or guidelines for the course related to references. Use some type of reference formatting, APA and AMA are good choices. 

### Quizzes								
Students will be required to complete a total of six (6) quizzes (weighted equally) based on the textbook readings for the course (see table below). Quizzes are to be completed on D2L before class on the due date. See table below for topics, associated readings, and due dates. Quizzes will be open book (i.e., you are allowed to have the textbook and any notes you make in front of you); however, you are not permitted to use any other resources or speak to any person (electronically or verbally) while completing the quiz. To prepare for the quiz read the appropriate chapter and make some notes for key points so that you can easily locate the answers while completing the quiz. Quizzes will generally consist of approximately 10 multiple choice questions and you will be allowed approximately 45 minutes (so you will have lots of time to complete the open book quiz). The first quiz consists of 15 multiple choice questions and you are allowed 60 minutes. If you have any technical problems while completing the quiz, please contact the instructor immediately via  email.

### Major Written Assignments
Students are required to write a major paper and will submit a draft and a final paper. Students will select from one of the following three (3) options for your major written assignment  

**1. Option A - Methodology Assignment**  

- Write a 2000-2500 word (not including title page or references) summary and critique of the quantitative methodologies and analyses used within a specific field of research. This is similar to a literature review which is an evaluation and summary of the knowledge and research within a specific field; however for this assignment rather than focussing on summarizing the knowledge of field you will summarize, evaluate and critique the methodologies and analyses within an area of research. This assignment is extremely useful to aid in the planning and development of a research study (e.g., your thesis). Topic must first be approved by instructor. Further details of the assignment will be provided in class and on D2L.   

**2. Option B – Statistical and Methodological Issues Journal Manuscript**    

- Write a 2500-3000 word publishable paper on general or specific statistical and methodical issues within the field of human kinetics and recreation. The primary objective is to highlight and discuss statistical and design issues which are commonly incurred and recommendations for future researchers grounded in literature. Your paper may discuss one issue in-depth or could present several issues. It may focus on only statistical issues, only methodological issues, or both. This assignment might be of interest to students who either a) have already proposed their thesis or are working on a specific project (i.e., design has already been decided) or b) have interest in learning more advanced statistical and design issues. Topic(s) must first be approved by instructor. Further details of the assignment will be provided in class and on D2L. Student papers may be considered as a basis for a co-publication or presentation with the instructor. 
 
**3. Option C – Research Journal Manuscript**

- Write a publishable manuscript in a format suitable for publication in a journal within your major topic area. Minimum page length is 8 pages (~2000 words) and maximum is 15 (~3600 words) not including references and tables. A research problem and research questions will be developed based on a secondary data set. Students are responsible for acquiring their own data set – speak to your supervisor and instructors, look on-line, or visit the QEII library. Data sets and project proposal must be approved by the instructor. The manuscript should include 1) introduction/literature review, 2) methods (design and analysis) and description of data, 3) results, and 4) discussion/conclusions. This assignment might be of interest to students with intermediate research/statistical knowledge and experience. Further details of the assignment will be provided in class and on D2L. Student papers may be considered as a basis for a co-publication with the instructor and/or other authors. If submitted for publication, students should consult with the instructor prior to publication to discuss authorship.

Students are encouraged to consult with the instructor and with their supervisor in selecting one of these options. The assignment will be completed/submitted in 2 Parts  

#### 1. Part 1 consists of submitting a draft which is a minimum of 4 pages in length for Options A and B and submitting at least the results section of your manuscript for Option C. (20% of Assignment grade)
#### 2. Part 2 consists of submitting the final paper. (80% of Assignment grade)

### Final Exam

Students will compelte an in-class 3 hour exam focussing on methodology and statistical topics/analysis learned throughout the course. Part A of the exam will first consist of multiple choice and short answers. Part B of the exam will be open book and will include the anlaysis of a data set.
